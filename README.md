# MastersoftheTree
We used a Red-Black Tree and a Weight-Balanced Tree to manipulate COVID19 deaths from various countries within a span of one year. 
Running The Code:
The covid data is already inserted into the tree by default. To run the code, you must simply select one of the various options. You may be prompted for addition inputs if you've selected 1,2, 4, or 5. You can use print (inorder) with option 3 or 6 to see the various countries available. You can choose between a red-black tree and a weight balanced tree to search and print.
